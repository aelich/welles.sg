                                    The barrier of entry for the blockchain space can oftentimes seem rather high, especially since the concept of blockchain and the benefits it provides is not yet as widely understood as other innovations. In order to overcome this barrier, this program will explore the main ideas, technologies, and ecosystem surrounding blockchain technology from both technical and non-technical standpoints. This program will help you develop the intuition for thinking of blockchain systems. You will learn the key strengths and motivations of distributed ledger technology, and also be exposed to the underlying mechanisms by which they function.

                                    This module focuses on the properties behind the second largest blockchain platform, Ethereum. We introduce the Ethereum Virtual Machine and the idea of Turing completeness, and examine some of the key protocol differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum, such as the UTXO vs. accounts model and functionality. We then look into some of the use cases of Ethereum, and conclude with an overview of smart contracts and building decentralized applications. Having spent the last modules primarily on cryptocurrencies, this module encourages students to think about blockchain use cases outside of cryptocurrency.

                                    The course covers many key topics in the blockchain space. First, we take a look at distributed systems and alternative consensus mechanisms, as well as cryptoeconomic and proof-of-stake. We then move on to the fundamental applications of bitcoin and blockchain technology, including exploring enterprise blockchain implementations (JP Morgan’s Quorum, Ripple, Tendermint, and HyperLedger), the challenges and solutions around scaling blockchain adoption, and the measures that the government is taking to regulate and control blockchain technology. We wrap up the course by also taking a look at the various blockchain ventures today and conclude with a blockchain-based future thought experiment.

                                    Blockchain architecture is built on the foundation of decades of computer science and distributed systems literature. We start out by providing a formal definition of distributed consensus and presenting foundational theoretical computer science topics such as the CAP Theorem and the Byzantine Generals Problem. We then explore alternative consensus mechanisms to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-work, including Proof-of-Stake, voting-based consensus algorithms, and federated consensus.

                                    One major obstacle to widespread blockchain adoption is the problem of scalability. We define scaling first as it relates to Bitcoin as a payment method, and compare it to more traditional forms of payment such as credit cards. We then consider the general blockchain scalability debate and look into some of the solutions that have been proposed for vertical scaling (e.g. blocksize increases, Segregated Witness, and the Lightning Network), as well as horizontal scaling (e.g. sidechains, sharding).
